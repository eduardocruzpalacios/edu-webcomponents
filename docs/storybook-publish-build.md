# Publish Storybook docs

## Deploy build artifacts into GitHub Pages by using GitHub Actions
- Select "GitHub Actions" option as source below "Build and deployment" in your repository's Settings (see Pages in menu)
- Use this workflow: https://storybook.js.org/docs/sharing/publish-storybook#github-pages
- After that, deployment should work when running the ad hoc job
